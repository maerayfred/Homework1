What is a data scientist?

A data scientist manages and cleans data, performs analyses, and communicates results, often collaborating with content specialists. From my experience at a Contract Research Organization (CRO), I've observed that Statistical Programmers align with both data scientists and statisticians.

Similarities:

-Knowledge of programming languages

-Strong statistical background

-Performing analyses

-Producing clear results

Differences:

Statisticians may have a more theoretical focus and are often more involved in experimental design. I currently view myself as more of a data scientist than a statistician.

##Code 
#Defining function y

```{r}
y<-density(iris$Petal.Width)
```

#Determining class/type/structure

```{r}
#Class
class(y)
#Type
typeof(y)
#Structure
str(y)

```

Creating Plot of y

```{r}
#| echo: false
plot(y)
```
